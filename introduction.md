## Help us Improve the Fiddler Everywhere Documentation
We believe that the documentation for a product is at its best when the content is a collaboration between the builders and consumers of that product. Everybody can play a role in making our documentation better and we encourage you to help us with that task in the way that you choose:

### Create an Issue

If you find an issue with our docs that needs to be addressed, the best way to let us know is by creating an issue in our [Github repository](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-everywhere-docs). When creating an issue, please provide a descriptive title, be as specific as possible and link to the documentation in question. If you can provide a link to the closest anchor to the issue, that is even better.

### Send a Pull Request

Creating an issue is great, but what we really love are pull requests. This is the most direct method. So, if you find an issue in the docs, or even feel like creating new content, we’d be happy to have your contributions! 

The basic steps are that you fork our documentation and submit a pull request. That way you may contribute to exactly where you found the error. After that, our technical writing team just needs to approve your change request. Please use only standard markdown. For more detailed instructions, please follow the [contribution instructions](https://github.com/telerik/fiddler-everywhere-docs#contributing) published in GitHub.
